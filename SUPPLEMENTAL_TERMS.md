All capitalized words not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the other Terms.

**1. Your Membership Rights and Obligations**

1.1 By paying the fixed subscription fee you will become a member of the Application. As a paying member you will gain exclusive access to various features on the Application.

The available online storage for the uploaded files may be limited based on the subscription plan.

(i) unless you hold all necessary rights, licenses and consents to do so and have fully complied with any such third-party licenses relating to User Content (including paying all royalties, fees and any other monies required to be paid in connection with such User Content);
(ii) that would cause you or us to breach any law, regulation, rule, code or other legal obligation;

**2. Accounts and Paid Subscription Packages**

2.1 We may make certain products and/or services available to users of the Application in consideration of a subscription fee or other fees (“Premium Services”), including the ability to purchase products and services from within the Application (“In-App Products”). If you choose to use Premium Services or make purchase of In-App Products via a third-party application store (like the App Store), then such third-party application store will charge you for any such applicable fees or charges (including any applicable taxes), according to their terms and conditions attributable to such purchase.

2.2 If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in-app purchase, you will continue to be billed for the subscription until you or we cancel it. The initial price and billing period will be as displayed via the Application. We may change the price at any time, but price changes will only apply to new purchases (including renewals). If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to follow the instructions from Apple to cancel your subscription before the next billing period starts, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the Application from your device. Deleting your member account or deleting the Application from your device does not cancel your subscription. You must cancel your Account as set forth in these Terms.

2.3 You retain the right to cancel your subscription at any time which must be done via your Apple account. Upon cancellation, you will continue to be subscribed to the Application until the conclusion of the relevant billing cycle, at which point your subscription and access to the Premium Services will cease.

2.4 If you cancel your subscription, following the subscription expiration date, BookPlayer reserves the right delete all files being stored on the platform.

**3. Billing Cycle and Payment**

3.1 The membership fee for the Premium Services, the purchase price of In-App Products, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as sales tax, VAT, and any other transaction fees, will be charged to you via your Apple account.

3.2 The length of your billing cycle will depend on the subscription type you select at sign-up for the subscription. Subscription fees will be payable on either an annual or per month basis.

3.3 In certain circumstances the payment date may change, for example, if your chosen method of payment has not successfully settled.

3.4 If a member exercises its cancellation right, BookPlayer or its billing agents will not charge further subscription fees following the date of cancellation. Members will retain access to Premium Services until the billing cycle concludes. The expiration date will be fixed in-application at the time of subscription.

3.5 All subscription fees are non-refundable.

3.6 BookPlayer may change your subscription fee from time to time, however, any price changes will apply to subsequent billing cycles only.

3.7 BookPlayer may, from time to time, offer new members a “free trial” period where subscription fees will be waived for a period of time. To avoid charges, you must cancel the free trial in the same manner as indicated above for cancellations of subscriptions before the free trial expires.
